# Battleships
### A Battleships game for two players
Welcome to Battleships Game! This is a simple React project that allows you to play the classic game of Battleships right in your browser.


### Description
It's my first ever project written using React :D It allows users to create new accounts, play battleships game against other players or a dummy AI player.
Currently it supports only Polish language. Players can enjoy the game only in front one one device. In the feature I would like to add online game mode, fully resposive layout and improved accessibility.


### Features
- Multi-player mode: Play against other players (currently only on one device).
- Single-player mode: Play against a ... not very clever AI opponent.
- Interactive gameplay: drag and drop ships onto the board
- Real-time feedback: Receive immediate feedback on hits, misses, and sunk ships.
- Sound effects: Enjoy the game with *immersive* sound effects.
